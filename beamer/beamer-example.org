* COMMENT Some remarks to options
  - [[info:org#Export%20settings][info:org#Export settings]]
  - ^:{} interpret abc_{subs} as subscript, but not abc_subs
  - num:t configures whether to use section numbers. If set to a number
    only headlines of this level or above will be numbered
  - ::t defines that lines starting with ":" will use fixed width font
  - |:t include tables in export
  - -:t Non-nil means interpret "\-", "--" and "---" for export.
  - f:t include footnotes
  - *:t Non-nil means interpret
    : *word*, /word/, _word_ and +word+.
  - <:t toggle inclusion of timestamps
  - timestamp:t include a document creation timestamp into the exported file
  - todo:t include exporting of todo keywords
  - d:nil do not export org heading drawers
  - tags:nil do not export headline tags


* Introduction
** Org mode version information

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output :exports results
    (princ (concat (format "Emacs version: %s\n" (emacs-version))
                   (format "org version: %s\n" (org-version))))
    
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : Emacs version: GNU Emacs 24.4.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.10.8)
  :  of 2014-10-31 on dflt1w
  : org version: 8.2.10

** Overview
- This is based on an [[http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html][the Worg hosted example by Eric S. Fraga]] and on the
  [[https://github.com/fniessen/refcard-org-beamer/blob/master/Org-Beamer-refcard.txt][beamer reference card]] by Fabrice Niessen on GitHub.
- The H:2 setting in the options line is important for setting the Beamer frame level. Headlines
  will become frames when their level is equal to =org-beamer-frame-level=.
- nice link: [[http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/][beamer theme matrix]]
- [[http://www.mathematik.uni-leipzig.de/~hellmund/LaTeX/beamer2.pdf][nice example on beamer features (pure Latex)]]
- http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~mischulz/beamer.html


** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:
- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.
The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

    \hfill \(\qed\)

** Some text features

   The double =@@= can be used to enclose avtive code. Here we use it to specify
   beamer code that will highlight text by specifying an overlay.
   
   A *@@beamer:<2->@@useful* feature

   The following setting acts like =\begin{itemize}[<+->]=. So, it will cause the
   list items to appear one after the other.

   #+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
   - item 1
   - item 2
   - item 3

** This is a notes page						     :B_note:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: note
   :END:

   This is a notes page with some information.
   
* A collection of example pages
** block environments
   
*** a block							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{block}{A block}
    ...
    \end{block}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** an alert block					       :B_alertblock:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: alertblock
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{alertblock}{An alert block}
    ...
    \end{alertblock}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** an example block					     :B_exampleblock:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: exampleblock
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{exampleblock}{An alert block}
    ...
    \end{exampleblock}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** some more blocks
*** a color box						   :B_beamercolorbox:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: beamercolorbox
    :END:
    The beamercolorbox does not seem to work
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{beamercolorbox}[shadow=true, rounded=true]{eecks}
    ...
    \end{beamercolorbox}
    #+END_EXAMPLE
     
** fullframe							:B_fullframe:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: fullframe
   :END:

   A =fullframe= is a =frame= with an ignored slide
   title. =frametitle= is set to the empty string

** ignoreheading					    :B_ignoreheading:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
   :END:

   - A headline with an =ignoreheading= environment will only have its contents
     displayed in the output. The heading text itself is ignored, and no
     heading bar is shown.
     + Contents are not inserted in any =frame= environment.

   - ignoreheading is useful as a structural element in order to again
     place normal text after a previous element (like a block or a
     column environment).

** =structureenv= environment
*** structureenv 					     :B_structureenv:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: structureenv
    :END:
    - For highlighting text.
    - To help the audience see the structure of your presentation.
    - *TODO:* Currently I see no effect on the text style when using
      structureenv

*** end of structureenv					    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
    - might need to use =ignoreheading= (like here) in order to then
      insert some more normal text after the structureenv.

** =definition= environment

   
*** definition						       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
    Contents of the definition

** =proof= environment and revealing line by line
*** proof							    :B_proof:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: proof
    :END:
    - <1-| alert@1> Suppose /p/ were the largest prime number.
    - <2-> Let /q/ be the product of the first /p/ numbers.
    - <3-> Then /q + 1/ is not divisible by any of them.
    - <4-> But /q + 1/ is greater than /1/, thus divisible by some prime number
      not in the first /p/ numbers.\qedhere

** Tables
   The size of the table font can be chosen by giving a =#+LATEX: \small=
   command (or =\tiny= or =\footnotesize=)

   #+LATEX: \footnotesize

* Using Beamer_act for overlays
** Two blocks
*** First Block 						    :B_block:
   :PROPERTIES:

   - this is visible from the beginning
*** Second Block 					       :B_alertblock:

   :BEAMER_env: alertblock
   :BEAMER_act: <2->
   :END:      
   - and this one is revealed afterwards by using the BEAMER_act
     keyword in the PROPERTIES section.
     
** Two blocks with invisible layering
#+LATEX: \setbeamercovered{invisible}
*** First Block 						    :B_block:
   :PROPERTIES:

   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: alertblock
   :BEAMER_act: <2->
   :END:      
   - and this one is revealed afterwards by using the BEAMER_act
     keyword in the PROPERTIES section.
     
** Three blocks with a different transparency setting
#+LATEX: \setbeamercovered{transparent=50}

*** First Block 						    :B_block:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: block
   :END:
   - this is visible from the beginning
*** Second Block 					       :B_alertblock:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: alertblock
   :BEAMER_act: <2->
   :END:      
   - and this one is revealed afterwards by using the BEAMER_act
     keyword in the PROPERTIES section.
     
*** Third Block 					       :B_alertblock:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: alertblock
   :BEAMER_act: <3->
   :END:      
   - and this one is revealed afterwards by using the BEAMER_act
     keyword in the PROPERTIES section.
     
* Multiple Columns
** Blocks in two columns

*** A left block					      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:

** A text section and a figure

*** A text section 						      :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      *example* block

*** A screenshot 					    :BMCOL:B_example:

# #+LATEX: \vbox to .2\textheight{%

    - a centered text section. I found no good way for
      using =\vfill= or =\minipage= as referenced [[http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/15244/why-does-vfill-not-work-inside-a-beamer-column][here]]

* Conclusions

** Summary
   - org is an incredible tool for time management
   - *but* it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
   - Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
   - the combination is unbeatable!
