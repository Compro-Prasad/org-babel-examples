* Introduction
** Org mode version information

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output :exports results
    (princ (concat (format "Emacs version: %s\n" (emacs-version))
                   (format "org version: %s\n" (org-version))))
    
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : Emacs version: GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.4.2)
  :  of 2014-02-22 on chindi10, modified by Debian
  : org version: 8.2.5h

** Overview
- This is based on an [[http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html][the Worg hosted example by Eric S. Fraga]] and on the
  [[https://github.com/fniessen/refcard-org-beamer/blob/master/Org-Beamer-refcard.txt][beamer reference card]] by Fabrice Niessen on GitHub.
- The H:2 setting in the options line is important for setting the Beamer frame level. Headlines
  will become frames when their level is equal to =org-beamer-frame-level=.
- nice link: [[http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/][beamer theme matrix]]
- [[http://www.mathematik.uni-leipzig.de/~hellmund/LaTeX/beamer2.pdf][nice example on beamer features (pure Latex)]]

** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:
- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.
The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

* A collection of example pages
** block environments
   
*** a block							    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{block}{A block}
    ...
    \end{block}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** an alert block					       :B_alertblock:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: alertblock
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{alertblock}{An alert block}
    ...
    \end{alertblock}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

*** an example block					     :B_exampleblock:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: exampleblock
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{exampleblock}{An alert block}
    ...
    \end{exampleblock}
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** some more blocks
*** a color box						   :B_beamercolorbox:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: beamercolorbox
    :END:
    This does not work
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    \begin{beamercolorbox}[shadow=true, rounded=true]{eecks}
    ...
    \end{beamercolorbox}
    #+END_EXAMPLE
     
** fullframe							:B_fullframe:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: fullframe
   :END:

   A =fullframe= is a =frame= with an ignored title. =frametitle= is set to the empty string

** ignoreheading					    :B_ignoreheading:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
   :END:

   - A headline with an =ignoreheading= environment will have its contents only
     inserted in the output.
     + Contents is not inserted in any =frame= environment.

   - This special value is useful to have data between frames, or to properly
     close a =column= environment.

** =structureenv= environment
*** structureenv 					     :B_structureenv:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: structureenv
    :END:
    - For highlighting text.
    - To help the audience see the structure of your presentation.

*** end of structureenv					    :B_ignoreheading:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :END:
    - might need to use =ignoreheading= in order to then insert some more normal text.

** =definition= environment

   
*** definition						       :B_definition:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: definition
    :END:
    Contents of the definition

** =proof= environment
*** proof							    :B_proof:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: proof
    :END:
    - <1-| alert@1> Suppose /p/ were the largest prime number.
    - <2-> Let /q/ be the product of the first /p/ numbers.
    - <3-> Then /q + 1/ is not divisible by any of them.
    - <4-> But /q + 1/ is greater than /1/, thus divisible by some prime number
      not in the first /p/ numbers.\qedhere

* Multiple Columns
** Two columns

*** A left block					      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - This is the first column

*** A right block					      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    - this is the right column
      
** Two columns

*** A block							      :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      *example* block

*** A screenshot 					    :BMCOL:B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.6
    :END:
    #+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth

** Babel
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_envargs: [t]
   :END:
*** Octave code						      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
#+name: octaveexample
#+begin_src octave :results output :exports both
A = [1 2 ; 3 4]
b = [1; 1];
x = A\b
#+end_src

*** The output						      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_envargs: <2->

* Conclusions

** Summary
   - org is an incredible tool for time management
   - @but@ it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
   - Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
   - the combination is unbeatable!
